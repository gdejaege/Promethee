* The files containing the set of reference profiles have been populated with different iterations of the
  adaptive questioning query procedures. There should therefore be some sets of reference profiles exactly

* Due to the point division process in the adaptive questioning procedure, it is normal that some sets of 
  refernce profiles are very similar one to the other.
